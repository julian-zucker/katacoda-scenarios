In this skills challenge, you will be implementing a function and a method in Python.

Before we start implementing that code, let's go through what we want that function and method to do.

We want to build a Markov chain that can predict the next letter in a sequence of letters. To make that happen, we first need to make a transition table from some input string. The transition table will tell us how often each letter is followed by each other letter. Then, we will use that transition table to implement a Markov chain that can make predictions.
